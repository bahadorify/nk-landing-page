        your favour or against you.',
  p5: 'In addition, there are risks associated with use of online deal\
        execution and trading systems including, but not limited to, software\
        and hardware failure and internet disconnection.',
  heading5: 'CRYPTOCURRENCIES',
  p6: 'Trading risks:&nbsp;Since Cryptocurrencies markets are decentralized and\
        non-regulated our Cryptocurrencies Trading Services are unregulated\
        services which are not governed by any specific European regulatory\
        framework (including MIFID). This means that there is no central bank\
        that can take corrective measure to protect the value of\
        Cryptocurrencies in a crisis or issue more currency. Therefore, when our\
        customers are using our Cryptocurrencies Trading Service they will not\
        benefit from the protections available to clients receiving regulated\
        investment services. Our customers will continue to benefit from the\
        rules relating to best execution and client money and safekeeping of\
        client assets.We will endeavor to enable you to benefit from rules\
        relating to best execution and safekeeping of client\
        assets.CRYPTOCURRENCIES MARKETS ARE DETERMINED BY DEMAND AND SUPPLY\
        ONLY. The Cryptocurrencies market is a dynamic arena and their\
        respective prices are often highly unpredictable and volatile. The\
        prices of Cryptocurrency is usually not transparent and highly\
        speculative and susceptible to market manipulation. In the worst case\
        scenario the product could be rendered worthless.It is important to make\
        a distinction between indicative prices which are displayed on charts\
        and dealable prices which are displayed on our trading platform.\
        Indicative quotes only give an indication of where the market is.\
        Because the Cryptocurrencies markets are decentralized, meaning it lacks\
        a single central exchange where all transactions are conducted, each\
        market maker may quote slightly different prices. Therefore, any prices\
        displayed on any chart made available by us or by a third party will\
        only reflect “indicative” prices and not necessarily actual “dealing”\
        prices where trades can be executed.Cryptocurrency trading is prone to\
        being misused for illegal activities due to the anonymity of\
        transactions and investors would be adversely affected if law\
        enforcement agencies investigate ay alleged illicit\
        activities.ACCORDINGLY, CRYPTOCURRENCIES SHOULD BE SEEN LIKE AS AN\
        EXTREMELY HIGH RISK ASSET AND YOU SHOULD NEVER INVEST FUNDS THAT YOU\
        CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE. Given the foregoing, Cryptocurrencies are not\
        appropriate for all investors. You should not deal in these products\
        unless you have the necessary knowledge and expertise, you understand\
        these products’ characteristics and your exposure to risk. You should\
        also be satisfied that the product is suitable for you in light of your\
        circumstances and financial position. In addition, use of our Services\
        can never be considered a safe investment rather only an investment with\
        a high risk of loss inherently associated with it. Furthermore, our own\
        spread is added to online quotes which makes a trade on our websites\
        even more volatile.The risk of loss in trading Cryptocurrencies can be\
        substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such\
        trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial\
        resources. You should be aware that You may sustain a total loss of the\
        funds in your Account. If the market moves against your position, you\
        may be called upon by us to provide a substantial amount of additional\
        margin funds, on short notice, in order to maintain your position. If\
        you do not provide the required funds within the time required by us,\
        your position may be liquidated at a loss, and you will be liable for\
        any resulting deficit in your account.NordikCoin.com currently allows\
        trading in cryptocurrencies over the weekend and it reserves the right\
        not to do so. Should NordikCoin.com so elects, trading in\
        cryptocurrencies shall be allowed only from Monday through Friday. Given\
        that the cryptocurrencies exchanges may operate over weekends, there may\
        be a significant difference between Friday’s close and Sunday’s open.\
        All such factors may result in you either not completing an order on a\
        specific trading day or completing an order on a substantially less\
        favorable price.Under certain market conditions, you may find it\
        difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for\
        example, when the market reaches a daily price fluctuation limit (“limit\
        move”), if there is insufficient liquidity in the market.Blockchain\
        Risks.&nbsp;Since blockchain is an independent public peer-to peer\
        network and is not controlled in any way or manner by NordikCoin.com,\
        NordikCoin.com shall not be responsible for any failure and/or mistake\
        and/or error and/or breach which shall occur in blockchain or in any\

        Cryptocurrency NordikCoin.com holds for your benefit. In the event of a\
        Fork, NordikCoin.com may temporarily suspend NordikCoin.com operations\
        (with or without advance notice to you) and that NordikCoin.com may (a)\
        configure or reconfigure its systems or (b) decide not to support (or\
        cease supporting) the Forked protocol entirely. NordikCoin.com may, but\
        is not obligated to do so, adjust your account in respect of a Fork\
        depending on the circumstances of each event attributable to any\
        specific Cryptocurrency held by You.Third Parties’ Risks.&nbsp;We may\
        elect to execute any order and/or hold any fiat money and\
        Cryptocurrencies via Third Parties. Such Third Parties are not banks\
        that hold their fiat money/virtual currency as a deposit. If any such\
        Third Party loses any money, fails or goes out of business, there is no\
        specific legal protection that covers you for losses arising from any\
        funds you may have held with such Third Party, even when such party is\
        registered with a national authority. Depending on the structure and\
        security of the digital wallet, some may be vulnerable to hacks,\
        resulting in the theft of virtual currency or loss of customer assets.\
        NordikCoin.com will not be responsible in the event of losses caused by\
        those Third Parties.Delisting and/or unsupported\
        Cryptocurrencies:&nbsp;If at any time any of the Cryptocurrencies that\
        forms the subject of your order is delisted and/or we no longer support\
        the trading in such Cryptocurrencies for any reason, then the applicable\
        order will be immediately closed. If NordikCoin.com is notified that a\
        Cryptocurrency you hold in your Account is likely to be delisted and/or\
        removed and/or canceled from any of the exchanges (some of them or all)\
        and NordikCoin.com believes that it shall not be able to trade in such\
        Cryptocurrencies, NordikCoin.com shall make an effort to sell the\
        Cryptocurrencies on your behalf at such time and price, and in such\
        manner, as it determines.',

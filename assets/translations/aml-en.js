  p21: 'NordikCoin, in line with the international requirements, has adopted a\
        risk-based approach (“RBA”) to combating money laundering and terrorist\
        financing. By adopting a risk-based approach, NordikCoin is able to\
        ensure that measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and\
        terrorist financing are commensurate to the identified risks. This will\
        allow resources to be allocated in the most efficient ways. The\
        principle is that resources should be directed in accordance with\

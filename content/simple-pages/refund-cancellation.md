1\. **Introduction**

OmniMatrix OÜ, trading under the name of NordikCoin.com (“NordikCoin”) is a company incorporated under the laws of Estonia, with a registered office at Estonia, Harju maakond, Tallinn, Kesklinna linnaosa, Roosikrantsi tn 2-K432, 10119. This Refund and Cancellation Policy applies to all users of the NordikCoin platform and shall be read and understood in conjunction with the general NordikCoin Terms of Service.

2\. **Cancellation by you**

Generally, Bitcoin transactions may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions or incorrect wallet addresses may not be recoverable. You acknowledge that all purchases and sales of crypto currency, whether completed or pending, on NordikCoin are final. The transactions are non-refundable, irrevocable and cannot be altered once completed.

The reason for this is that crypto currency rates fluctuate constantly. Hence, the value of the crypto currency purchased from, or sold to, NordikCoin will change within moments after your purchase or sale.

By clicking the “Buy” or “Sell” button on the NordikCoin website, you acknowledge that the EU consumer protection directive (known as Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of 25 October 2011 on consumer rights) does not apply to contracts for financial service, such as the ones NordikCoin offers.

3\. **Refunds**

If you decide to change your mind and wish to return the crypto currency purchased from NordikCoin, NordikCoin will be able, at its sole discretion, to buy it back from you based on the current market rate minus the service fee payable for the transaction. For this purpose, please contact NordikCoin via email at support@nordikcoin.com.

The above shall also apply mutatis mutandis in cases where you sold crypto currency to NordikCoin and would like to purchase them back, in which case NordikCoin will be able, at its sole discretion, to sell it to you based on the current market rate, plus the service fee payable for the transaction.

4\. **Cancellation by NordikCoin**

In rare circumstances, such as if (i) your submitted KYC documents are proven fraudulent; (ii) if you share your log in data to your account with a third party; or (iii) if we suspect illegal activity in relation to your account, NordikCoin reserves the right to cancel any order made by you on the NordikCoin platform.<br>In the event NordikCoin cancels your order, and if NordikCoin already has received the funds from you with regards to the order, NordikCoin will, subject to applicable Estonian law and regulation, refund such funds to you.

Such refund shall be made to the same source from which they have originated, after deduction of any cost or expense NordikCoin incurs with regards to such transfer, including without limitation any wire transfer charges, currency exchange charges and/or payment processing charges.

Your funds may, at NordikCoin’s sole discretion, be returned to another source to which you are the beneficiary, as long as you provide us with the required documents and information to verify that the account to which the funds were requested to be refunded belongs to you.

5\. **AML, CTF and right of refusal**

To comply with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regulations (AML and CTF) or any other regulations and to prevent prohibited conduct, all payments and information related to the aforementioned refund may be verified by NordikCoin. In such case, NordikCoin may request from you, at its sole discretion, to provide certain documents and information, including without limitation identification documents, copy of your credit card or bank details and/or any other proof required to affect the refund.

In case you fail to provide appropriate documents or information, or in case of any doubts as to the authenticity of provided documents and information, NordikCoin shall be entitled to halt the refund process until you take appropriate measures, as requested.

Notwithstanding the above, NordikCoin reserves the right to cancel your order without any refund, or decline any refund request, if it suspects that you have or are engaged in, or have in any way been involved in, fraudulent or illegal activity.

Refund will be processed without undue delay, and in any event within 14 (fourteen) business days from cancellation of order, subject to the requirements set forth hereinabove, and provided that you do not fail to provide NordikCoin with any information and/or documentation required in order to process the refund.

Warranties

Except as expressly stated herein, NordikCoin makes no warranty or representa&shy;tion as to the merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, workmanship or any other warranty concerning any product or service purchased from or through NordikCoin.

Amendments to this policy

The terms and conditions of the Refund and Cancellation Policy are subject to change. In the case of any amendments, NordikCoin will update the policies online. The changes will apply after NordikCoin has made such changes.

In case you do not wish to accept the revised Refund and Cancellation Policy, you cannot continue to use NordikCoin platform for your crypto currency purchases. If you still continue to use the platform after the date on which the changes comes into effect, your use of NordikCoin shall be bound by the new Refund and Cancellation Policy.
